## A quick and sloppy cli for saving time :dog:

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/floppy-scripts) ![David](https://img.shields.io/david/dankreiger/floppy-scripts)

- unfortunately it is not yet floppy, but rather sloppy

### Prerequisites

- node
- npx
- yarn
- nvm

### Usage

- add to a create-react-app project when using `yarn` to cut down on common repetitive tasks

- Don't use this unless you are me since this is super messy
- So Dan - since you're the only one using this... for now, do everything from the root of the project
- it's a mess, it's just for me - so you can check it out if you're curious about sloppy code written in 30 minutes

### Install with yarn:

```sh
  $ yarn add floppy-scripts
```

### Run the cli :

```sh
  $ yarn run floppy
```

### TODO:

- add script for react router
- add script for reselect
- add changelog generator script
- make it compatible with npm too

### Nice to haves, but probably not necessary since VS Code has snippets for these

- action generators
- action test generators
- reducer generators
- reducer test generators
- component test generators

### TODO for real:

- make a real version of this maybe (with options for TS or JS)
- write tests first
- plan folder structure before you write this
- do it when you feel like you have some time
