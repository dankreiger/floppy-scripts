## A quick and sloppy cli for saving time

### Usage

- add to a create-react-app project when using `yarn`

- Don't use this unless you are me since this is super messy
- So Dan - since you're the only one using this... for now, do everything from the root of the project
- it's a mess, it's just for me - so you can check it out if you're curious about sloppy code written in 30 minutes 

***

### Install with yarn:

```sh
  $ yarn add floppy-scripts
```

### Run the cli :

```sh
  $ yarn run floppy
```

***

### TODO:

- add script to allow user to specify node version 
- add script for jest + enzyme
- add script for react router
- finish redux scripts
- finish script for styled-components
- make it compatible with npm too

### TODO for real:

- make a real version of this maybe (with optiions for TS or JS)
- write tests first
- plan folder structure before you write this
- do it when you feel like you have some time
