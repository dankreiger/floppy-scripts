### A quick and sloppy cli for saving time

### Usage

- add to a create-react-app project when using `yarn`

- Don't use this unless you are me since this is super messy - for now, do everything from the root of the project

Install with yarn:

```sh
  $ yarn add floppy-scripts
```

Run the cli :

```
  $ yarn run floppy-scripts
```

### TODO:

make a real version of this maybe
